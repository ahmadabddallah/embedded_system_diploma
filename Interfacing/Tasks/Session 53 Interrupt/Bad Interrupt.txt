what will happen if you turn on interrupt without initilzing it with ISR ?

the ISR call Bad_Interrupt and it will change the Program Counter to the reset handler reset the whole system

bad interrupt can be changed to function that toggle led or something 

so why we are using it ?
it's useful for deubgging
